# AI-Based Secure Pharmacovigilance Follow-Up System

## 📌 Overview
Pharmacovigilance (PV) systems often receive adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports with missing critical information such as patient age, dosage, onset date, or seriousness. Manual follow-ups are inefficient, repetitive, and face low response rates from busy doctors and hesitant patients.

This project implements an **AI-based, privacy-first pharmacovigilance follow-up system** that automatically detects missing information, collects it securely using one-time links, standardizes reactions using **MedDRA coding**, and generates **E2B(R3)-style XML** for regulatory submission.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Automatically detect missing mandatory fields in ADR reports
- Minimize user burden with zero-login, minimal follow-up forms
- Ensure GDPR, HIPAA, and ALCOA+ compliance
- Standardize adverse events using MedDRA Preferred Terms
- Generate E2B-compliant XML for regulatory reporting
- Provide a Safety Officer dashboard for monitoring and compliance
